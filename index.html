		<p>Fred Hampton was born on August 30, 1948 and raised in the Chicago suburb of Maywood, Illinois. He grew up as a fantasic student, excelling in both academics and athletics, dreaming of playing baseball for the New York Yankees. Hampton graduated from Proviso East High School in 1966 before heading to Triton Junior College where he studied law. He wanted to study law in order to help other African Americans fight against police brutality. Hampton also became involved in the civil rights movement, joining the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), which expanded which allowed the branch to expand to 500 members. Hampton was able to successfully lobby city officials to create better academic services and recreational facilities for African American children as the position of Youth Council President.</p>

		<p>Even after his successful campaigns with NAACP, the Black Panther Party's radicalism resonated with him much more. Hampton joined the Chicago chapter of the Black Panther Party (BPP) in November 1968. During his brief BPP occupation, Hampton formed a “Rainbow Coalition” which included Students for a Democratic Society, the Blackstone Rangers, a street gang, and the National Young Lords,which was a Puerto Rican organization. Hampton was also broadcasted on local television while he was negotiating gang truces.  He quickly rose to a leadership position, becoming the chairman of the Illinois chapter of the Party finally the deputy chair of the national BPP. He engaged in grassroots activism, working as an organizer, a peacemaker, and taking part in the BPP’s free breakfast program and people’s medical clinic.</p>

		<p>From the 1950s until the 1970s, the FBI’s Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO) targeted leaders of activist organizations and civil rights leaders such as the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. as well as radical groups like the Black Panther Party, the American Indian Movement, and the Young Lords. Because of Hampton's rise to power, the FBI had begun to keep an eye on him, opening a file in 1967. The FBI enlisted a man named William O'Neal to infiltrate and sabotage the Black Panthers Party. O'Neal agreed to this under the promise that the FBI will drop his charges.  O’Neal quickly gained access to Hampton by becoming both his bodyguard and a security director in Hampton’s Black Panther Party chapter. Following FBI director J. Edgar Hoover’s orders, O’Neal undid much of Hampton’s work to foster peace in the community, leading community members to lose confidence in the BPP</p>
		
		<p>On the evening of December 3, 1969, O’Neal slipped a powerful sleeping drug into Hampton’s drink then left. Officers were dispatched into an early morning raid on Hampton’s apartment. Despite not having a warrant for weapons charges, they entered the apartment with guns firing. They mortally wounded Mark Clark, who was guarding Hampton. Hampton and his fiancee, Deborah Johnson (also called Akua Njeri), were asleep in their bedroom. After several shots, the officers realized Hampton was only wounded and conintued to shoot two bullets into his head, leaving Johnson alive with their expected child.</p>
		
		<p>The panthers left alive, including Johnson, were arrested and charged with attempting to murder the police. The police claimed that several shots were being fired by the BPP, which justified the police's shooting. However, it was later discovered that only one bullet had been fired by the Panthers whereas nearly a hundred came from police guns.</p>
